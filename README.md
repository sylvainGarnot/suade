Suade Labs
JS Challenge 2020
Job: JS Dev – Frontend Picasso

Introduction
This coding exercise is designed to allow you to demonstrate your skills and implement some basic frontend functionality. The goal of this exercise is to get a better understanding of your:

	 Proficiency with javascript, json and data handling
	 Ability to write semantic HTML and extensible CSS
	 How you structure an application from scratch (i.e. how do you build it)
	 How you “document” your code (i.e. can someone else understand it)
	 How you “test” your code (I.e. make sure it does what you think it does)
	 Approach and creativity to solving open-ended problems

Exercise
Choose one of the given technologies, and create a JS project to build a SPA for the given scenarios.

We are expecting you to deliver your work as a GIT project, with a README file containing instructions on how to install/run the project. The project should fit on a single page application with multiple states and should allow the user to complete all listed user stories.

We value code testing greatly, so please write tests (unit, integration or e2e tests)!
